# Joel Adrian - Stunt performer
This is Milestone Project 1: User Centric Frontend Development - at Code Institute.


This is a website that functions as a portfolio for Joel Adrian, Stunt Performer. The portfolio enables all of Joels work to be gathered and shown in one place, in form of photos, videos and a resume.
The website have five pages that shows a presentation of Joel, what kind of work he have done and how you can contact him or follow him on social media. 
(One or two paragraphs providing an overview of your project.
Essentially, this part is your sales pitch.)




## UX
After doing research looking at websites from the stunt performer community and interview Joel about his wishes and needs with the portfolio, my goal with the design was set: 
1. That it would be easy to find what you want on the website. 
2. The design would be suitable for the stunt-community with colors that give a feeling of a tough and rough edge, but still with a stylistic and minimal design.

Use this section to provide insight into your UX process, focusing on who this website is for, what it is that they want to achieve and how your project is the best way to help them achieve these things.

In particular, as part of this section we recommend that you provide a list of User Stories, with the following general structure:

### User stories
As a user type, I want to perform an action, so that I can achieve a goal.
* As a colleague in the business I want to have a look at Joel Adrians work to find out what projects he´s busy on, befriend him on social media to expand my network in the business, and send him a message on the contact page with a collaboration idea.

* As a martial artist or exreme sportsman I want to have a look at Joels videos,  pictures and resume to get inspired and learn about a career in the movie industry. 

* As a coordinator, director or possible employer I want to have a look at his showreel and photos. I also want to read his resume and download it, so that I can hire him for a project. 

* As a fan of Joel Adrian I want to look at pictures and videos of him, so I can get to know more about him. I also want to find out where I can follow him on social media. 



This section is also where you would share links to any wireframes, mockups, diagrams etc. that you created as part of the design process. These files should themselves either be included in the project itself (in an separate directory), or just hosted elsewhere online and can be in any format that is viewable inside the browser.



## Features
In this section, you should go over the different parts of your project, and describe each in a sentence or so.
* The navbar and the footer have the same color, so every page will give a sense of a familiarity, even though the content is changing.
* I planned for the scrollbar to be descrete. That´s why I chose a background color that is slightly darker than the navbar and the footer. I chose not to have the same color as them, so it won´t give the impression that they float together as one element. 

### Existing Features
Feature 1 - allows users X to achieve Y, by having them fill out Z
...
For some/all of your features, you may choose to reference the specific project files that implement them, although this is entirely optional.

In addition, you may also use this section to discuss plans for additional features to be implemented in the future:

## Technologies Used
In this section, you should mention all of the languages, frameworks, libraries, and any other tools that you have used to construct this project. For each, provide its name, a link to its official site and a short sentence of why it was used.

JQuery
The project uses JQuery to simplify DOM manipulation.

## Testing

As a new visitor to the site, I want to be able to find everything I need easily. Therefor the navbar have been placed in the conventional position at the top of the page, and each of the page sections are clearly labelled in it.
The footer is also placed in the conventional place in the bottom of the page. Here I have placed links to Social media and a link to download the resume, so the needs for possible employers, coordinators or directors to get the resume information will be able to get this quickly from whatever page they are currently on.

In this section, you need to convince the assessor that you have conducted enough testing to legitimately believe that the site works well. Essentially, in this part you will want to go over all of your user stories from the UX section and ensure that they all work as intended, with the project providing an easy and straightforward way for the users to achieve their goals.

Whenever it is feasible, prefer to automate your tests, and if you've done so, provide a brief explanation of your approach, link to the test file(s) and explain how to run them.

For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:

1. Contact form:
Go to the "Contact Us" page
Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.
In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.

## Deployment
This section should describe the process you went through to deploy the project to a hosting platform (e.g. GitHub Pages or Heroku).

In particular, you should provide all details of the differences between the deployed version and the development version, if any, including:

Different values for environment variables (Heroku Config Vars)?
Different configuration files?
Separate git branch?
In addition, if it is not obvious, you should also describe how to run your code locally.
