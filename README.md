# Joel Adrian - Stunt performer
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This is Milestone Project 1: User Centric Frontend Development - at Code Institute.

This is a website that functions as a portfolio for Joel Adrian, Stunt Performer. The portfolio enables all of Joels work to be gathered and shown in one place, in form of photos, videos and a resume.
The website have five pages that shows a presentation of Joel, what kind of work he have done and how you can contact him or follow him on social media.

## UX
After doing research looking at websites from the Stunt Performer community and interviewing Joel about his wishes and needs with the portfolio, my goals with the design was set to: 
1. To make the design suitable for the stunt-community with fonts and colors that provides a feeling of a tough and rough edge, but still maintain a stylistic and clean design.
2. To make 5 pages with it´s own categorical content on each page, to keep it easy to find what you want on the site and to maintain a clean impression with all the media content I´m including on the website.

### User stories
* As a colleague in the business I want to have a look at Joel Adrians work to find out what projects he´s busy on, befriend him on social media to expand my network in the business, and send him a message on the contact page with a collaboration idea.

* As a martial artist or exreme sportsman I want to have a look at Joels videos,  pictures and resume to get inspired and learn about a career in the movie industry. 

* As a coordinator, director or possible employer I want to have a look at his showreel and photos. I also want to read his resume and download it, so that I can hire him for a project. 

* As a fan of Joel Adrian I want to look at pictures and videos of him, so I can get to know more about him. I also want to find out where I can follow him on social media. 

### Wireframes
The wireframes I did as a part of the design process are saved as pdf documents and kept in a separate folder in this project, which is called **wireframe**. One is designed for desktop view and the other for mobile view.
I worked with the wireframes in Balsamic. **Can I link directly here in the text to the wireframe directory?**
(This section is also where you would share links to any wireframes, mockups, diagrams etc. that you created as part of the design process. These files should themselves either be included in the project itself (in an separate directory), or just hosted elsewhere online and can be in any format that is viewable inside the browser.)


## Features
(In this section, you should go over the different parts of your project, and describe each in a sentence or so.)
### Existing Features
(Feature 1 - allows users X to achieve Y, by having them fill out Z)
* The About me page is the landing page and gives a short introduction to Joel Adrian. 
* The My work page shows Joels resume directly on the page to be easily overviewed before you possibly want to download it. Under it it´s also possible to click on an icon to be able to download it. Underneath the resume area it´s also possible to click on another icon to get to Joel Adrians IMDB page.
* The Videos page include three videos that shows what kind of stunts Joel is able to to and clips from movies.
* The Photos page shows images in one row that is clickable and will show in a separate window if clicked on.
* The Contact page include a contact form that gives the opportunity to get in touch with Joel with collaboration ideas or job opportunities. The contact form is placed with no other content on the page to be easily accessed and also gives clear instructions so the users quickly can send a message to Joel.
* The navbar and the footer have the same color, so every page will give a sense of a familiarity, even though the content is changing.
* The navbar collapse on smaller screens, which provides a discrete design and simple user experience with the menu items grouped together.
* I planned for the scrollbar to be discrete. That´s why I chose a background color that is slightly darker than the navbar and the footer. I chose not to have the same color as them, so it won´t give the impression that they float together as one element. 
* The fullwidth background image is suppose to remind the users what Joel is all about, a Stunt Performer with experience in the movie industry. The content scrolls infront of the image which is the same on all pages, to give a sense of familiarity with a recognizable design. 
* Joels name is not conventionally placed up in the left corner as a brand or logo, on purpose. After his wishes with a discrete design we agreed on only having his name in the title and on the landing page, and let the background image remind the users of who´s website they´re on. 
* The Download my resume link and the Social links is placed in the footer to be easily accessed on every page on the website.
* A custom scrollbar is added so the users can be able to scroll up and down all of the pages when needed. Smooth scroll effect is added.
* The hover effects on the icons and navbar items is designed with a dark color to suit the users and the transition effect is set to feel smooth.

### Features Left to Implement
1. In the future I want to add more videos to expand the feeling of Joel as an experienced Stunt Performer. The videos that are included now are the ones that Joel currently wants to share.
2. In the future I also want to change the current image grid to a lightbox, for the users to be able to see the images on the same page they are currently on. I want to test this to see if this technique changes the amount of clicks on the Photos page and to make the experience more user friendly on smaller screens.

## Technologies Used
* **The languages** I have used for this project is [HTML5](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html5_intro.asp) and [CSS3](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS3). I have used Bootstrap grid with the built in media queries for the content to be responsive on all screen sizes. 
* **The libraries** included are the Javascript libraries [JQuery](https://jquery.com/) and [Popper.js](https://popper.js.org/). And also [Fontawesome](https://fontawesome.com/) to add icons.
* **Frameworks** I have used is Bootstrap 4.3.1. I used the BootstrapCDN on [this page](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.3/getting-started/introduction/)
* **Other tools** I have used are [Cloud9 IDE](https://aws.amazon.com/cloud9/?origin=c9io) for the development of this site: writing, debugging and running my code. GIT was then used to push files to [Github](http://github.com) where the project is stored and deployed.
* As part of the **design process** i chose to use [Balsamic](https://balsamiq.com/) to make my wireframes in a simple way with a goodlooking result.


(In this section, you should mention all of the languages, frameworks, libraries, and any other tools that you have used to construct this project. For each, provide its name, a link to its official site and a short sentence of why it was used.
JQuery- The project uses JQuery to simplify DOM manipulation.)

## Testing
Here I present how my website meet the needs of the different kinds of users that will visit the site, which I presented in the section UX: User stories:
* As a colleague in the business I want to have a look at Joel Adrians work to find out what projects he´s busy on, befriend him on social media to expand my network in the business, and send him a message on the contact page with a collaboration idea. --> This information can be easily found since all page sections are clearly labelled in the navbar which is placed in the conventional place on top of the page.
Since the footer is also placed in the conventional bottom of the page position, it will be easy to find the social links positioned there regardless on which page they are currently on.

* As a martial artist or exreme sportsman I want to have a look at Joels videos, pictures and resume to get inspired and learn about a career in the movie industry. --> This information will be easily found in the clearly labelled page sections in the navbar. In the page My work they can have a look at the resume, without having to download it, and play the videos directly in the webpage to see some clips.

* As a coordinator, director or possible employer I want to have a look at his showreel and photos. I also want to read his resume and download it, so that I can hire him for a project. --> The showreel will be found in the Videos page, and the resume can be downloaded from the footer from any page, but to have a preview of the resume directly on the page before downoading is intentionally made for this type of user.

* As a fan of Joel Adrian I want to look at pictures and videos of him, so I can get to know more about him. I also want to find out where I can follow him on social media. --> The images and pictures are clearly labelled in the navbar to find, and the social links is possible to click on from any page, that the fans are currently on. 

#### Validation of code
* I used [this website](https://validator.w3.org/#validate_by_input) to validate my HTML by direct input.
* I used [this website](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/validator.html.en#validate_by_input) to validate my CSS by direct input.

#### The responsive parts of the website
* The responsive navbar collapse as planned on smaller screens, and take place in the top center of the screen.
* The responsive image grid with the one column design looks good on smaller screens as well as the larger. 
* The embedded videos also changes in it´s size when making the screen size smaller and is still good to watch.
* The embedded pdf resume document is responsive, and on smaller screens the scrollbars in the document appears even horizontally. 
* The contactform act responsive when the screen gets smaller and still functions properly. 

(Write about how each part of your responsive website behaves on different screen sizes)

(In this section, you need to convince the assessor that you have conducted enough testing to legitimately believe that the site works well. Essentially, in this part you will want to go over all of your user stories from the UX section and ensure that they all work as intended, with the project providing an easy and straightforward way for the users to achieve their goals.)

(Whenever it is feasible, prefer to automate your tests *what does this mean, automate your tests?*, and if you've done so, provide a brief explanation of your approach, link to the test file(s) and explain how to run them.)
(For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:

#### Testing process scenarios 
1. **Contact form** 
* Go to the "Contact" page
* Try to submit the form with all the fields empty, and verify that a relevant error message shows up. 
* Try to submit the form with an invalid email adress (without the @ character), and verify that a relevant error message shows up.
* Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears in a new window. 
* Try this process on smaller screen sizes and verify that the form is responsive and works on all sizes. 
* Bug discovered, which is not adressed yet: When typing an email with the @ character but without the . dot the form could be submitted anyway.

2. **Download resume in footer**
* Click on Download my resume in the footer.
* Click on the download icon, and verify that the resume in pdf format opens up in a new tab.
* Click on the download button in the top right corner of the document and verify that I can download it to my computer. 
* At last close the tab and go back to the website.

3. **Download resume in My work page**
* Go to the "My work" page and verify that the embedded pdf is showing, and that it´s possible to zoom and scroll in the document at the My work page. 
* Click on download button on the embedded pdf and verify that it can be downloaded to my computer from here as well.
* Scroll down the page and click on the download icon under the text "Click here to download my resume!" located just under the pdf document, and verify that the pdf opens up in a new tab and is possible to download to my computer. 
* Try this process on smaller screen sizes and verify that the pdf is responsive and that this works on smaller screens.

4. **Social links**
* Click on the icons in the footer, on by one, and verify that they open up in separate tabs leading to the social links: Facebook, Instagram and IMDB. 
* Click on the icons from all pages and verify that this is working.
* At last go to My work page and I click on the IMDB icon under the resume Pdf document, under the text "My IMDB page. Check it out here!, and then verify that this link is working. 


* **Bugs I came across while creating the site and while testing it**
When testing the webiste on smaller screen sizes I discovered that half of the footer disappears underneath the edge of the screen. 
The content on the web pages also disappears underneath it. I tried to change the position to relative and absolute intstead of fixed to the bottom. But this did not work. 
* **present the solution when I find it**
(Include the fixes you came up with.)

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.*how do I do this?*

## Deployment
**This website is hosted on GitHub pages, and deployed from the master branch by following these steps:**
* In the repository, click on settings in top right corner.
* Scroll down the page to GitHub Pages section.
* In the source dropdown you chose the alternative master branch.
* The published link will appear in the GitHub Pages section.
* Click on the link and you will reach the website.

Upon new commits to the master branch, the deployed site will automatically update. 
The landing page must be named index.html for the site to deploy correctly on GitHub pages.

**To run locally- You can clone this repository directly into the editor you prefer by following these steps:**
