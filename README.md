# Joel Adrian Portfolio
This is my first Milestone project in Code Institutes course Full Stack Web Developing, in the user centric front end development part of the education. 

This is a portfolio for Joel Adrian, stunt performer. The portfolio enables all of Joels work to be gathered and shown in one place, in form of photos and videos. With this portfolio it will be easier for colleagues in the business to check him out, for aspiring stunt performers to get inspired, possible employers to reach him and his fans will also be able to easier find him on social media and have a look at his work.
